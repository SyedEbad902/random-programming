//You are given a string representing a sentence, where each word is separated by a single space. Write a TypeScript function called reverseWords that reverses the order of the words in the sentence.
//The words themselves should not be reversed, only their order in the sentence should be.

const sentence = "Hello world this is TypeScript";
const result = reverseWords(sentence);
console.log(result);
